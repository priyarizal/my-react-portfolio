            Hello, My name is Priya Rizal, a full stack developer living in Berkeley, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an undergrad, I studied International Relations, and Womens Studies at Mills College in Oakland, CA. I also have a Human Rights advocacy background educated at the University of Pennsylvania.

            I recently realized my passion for web development. As someone who had stuck to social sciences and humanities all my life, the pandemic shook me into wanting change for myself. I craved another outlet of self expression. I had been in the peripheral of the coding world for a while and decided to try it myself. I started where every newbie starts- youtube. After countless hours of youtubing how to be a developer, and creating basic static websites with HTML and CSS I decided this was the change I looking for. I joined the UC Berkeley's Full-Stack coding bootcamp and had the most thrilling, productive, intense, and academically rigorous summer of my life.

            Right now, I specialize in Front End and Back End JavaScript and writing programs in React and Node.js. I am skilled in Object-Oriented programming with a demonstrated history of working with various software and technology. I am also experinced in designing schemas in MySQL/MongoDB.

            This portfolio is built with React.js.
